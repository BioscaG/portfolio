    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Project Context</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        This project was undertaken as part of my internship at Airfi, a technology-focused company working closely with hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers. The main goal was to develop a reliable and efficient fall detection system to enhance safety for elderly individuals. The system was designed to work in real-time using wearable devices equipped with accelerometers and gyroscopes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Airfi specializes in creating innovative solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing healthcare infrastructures. This project was part of a larger initiative to leverage IoT devices to provide continuous monitoring for patients in residential care facilities. The system aimed not only to detect falls but also to collect valuable data that could be used to prevent future incidents by analyzing patterns of movement and activity.

    <!-- Challenges -->
    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Challenges</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-300">
        <li>Ensuring high accuracy in detecting falls while minimizing false positives. False alarms could lead to unnecessary stress for caregivers and healthcare providers.</li>
        <li>Managing noisy and incomplete data from the wearables during real-world usage. The data collected in different environments, such as hospitals and nursing homes, often contained artifacts that needed to be filtered out.</li>
        <li>Optimizing communication between wearable devices and routers for real-time data transmission. This involved configuring the MQTT protocol to handle data spikes without delays or loss of information.</li>
        <li>Designing a scalable system capable of processing large volumes of data generated by hundreds of wearable devices deployed across multiple facilities.</li>
        <li>Creating a user-friendly interface that could be easily adopted by non-technical staff for monitoring and maintenance.</li>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Infrastructure and Workflow</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        The system was built on a robust infrastructure designed to handle real-time data flow. The workflow was structured as follows:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-gray-300">
        <li>Wearable devices continuously collected acceleration and gyroscope data, providing a detailed view of movements in three dimensions.</li>
        <li>Data was transmitted via MQTT to local routers, ensuring minimal latency. The routers acted as intermediaries, buffering data in case of network interruptions.</li>
        <li>Routers forwarded the data to a central server for processing and storage. The server was equipped with redundant systems to ensure reliability and data integrity.</li>
        <li>Machine learning models processed incoming data to detect potential falls. The models were optimized to run in real-time, making predictions within milliseconds of receiving data.</li>
        <li>Alerts were generated in real-time for caregivers or healthcare staff. Alerts included details like the time of the fall, device ID, and location, enabling prompt response.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Additionally, the system incorporated data visualization dashboards, providing insights into patient activity levels, fall risk assessments, and overall system performance. These dashboards were instrumental in engaging stakeholders and demonstrating the system's impact.
